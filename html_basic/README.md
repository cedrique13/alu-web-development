# html_basic

This project is about learning the basics of HTML.

It includes:

- Creating a valid HTML page structure
- Using headings, paragraphs, images, and links
- Building navigation between pages
- Embedding tweets
- Organizing content with `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`

## Files

- `base_index.html`: A basic empty HTML template
- `index.html`: Contains text, headings, a clickable image, and a link to `tweets.html`
- `tweets.html`: Shows an embedded tweet and a link back to `index.html`

Later updates include a more organized structure using semantic HTML tags.

## Notes

- No CSS or JavaScript used
- The HTML should be valid (checked with W3C Validator)
- The footer includes a link with the authorâ€™s name
